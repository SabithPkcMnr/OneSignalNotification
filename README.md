This is simple Splash Screen App | The Splash screen is used for basically two things. Number one usage of splash screen is to welcome our app users to into the app with a nice UI and the second critical usage is to make sure your app loads all the basic information while the Splash screen is being displayed to the user.

## Implementation
Now the timer is based on `postDelayed()` public method. This method will help us to queue a process to a certain period of time that we set for the method and app will perform that task after that time period.
